Create Main Control
- Move the elevator to the target floor 
- Send out a served once the elevator has reached that floor. 
- Control the engine and the cabin_doors.

Engine
- The engine can be instructed to move up or down
- Or to stop. 
- Once the engine starts moving, it will start sensors. 
- Each time the elevator reaches a floor, these sensors will send a reached_floor to the MainControl. 
- When the elevator is moving up or down, the floor sensors indicate when a new floor is reached (Note that the sensors do not tell the floor number)
- It is the task of MainControl to keep track of its current position. 

Doors
- When the destination floor is reached, MainControl should stop the engine and open the door. 
- Once the doors are open, the served signal can be sent to the RequestHandler.
- The cabin_doors can be instructed to open or close. 
- Each floor has a protecting_door that is closed by default, and that should be open only when the elevator is standing still at that floor. 
- When the cabin_door is given the signal to close, they will first close the protecting doors of the current floor. 
- Once these are closed, the cabin_door will be closed. 
- For opening, it is similar. Note that the elevator cabin always waits for passengers in a state where its cabin door and the protecting door are open.
